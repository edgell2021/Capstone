# Capstone Project

Initial code based on Project 3 & Project 4. This project requires you to build out a travel app that, at a minimum, obtains a desired trip location & date from the user, and displays weather and an image of the location using information obtained from external APIs.

Use GeoNames, Darksky and Pixabay APIs for information on travel location
